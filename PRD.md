## Legacy Travel Reimbursement System Analysis

### 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** Legacy Travel Reimbursement System Reverse Engineering  
**Duration:** 60+ Years of Operation  
**Current Status:** Active Production System  
**Business Impact:** Critical - processes $2.3M annually in reimbursements  

### 2. Business Problem

ACME Corporation has been using a legacy travel reimbursement system for over 60 years. The system processes employee travel expense reimbursements but:

- **No Documentation Exists:** All original documentation has been lost over the decades
- **Knowledge Gap:** No current employees understand the business logic
- **System Modernization:** A new system has been developed but produces different results
- **Compliance Risk:** Unable to explain reimbursement calculations to auditors
- **Operational Dependency:** System is critical but becomes more fragile each year

### 3. Current System Characteristics

#### Input Parameters
- `trip_duration_days` (integer): Number of days spent traveling
- `miles_traveled` (integer): Total miles traveled during the trip  
- `total_receipts_amount` (float): Total dollar amount of submitted receipts

#### Output
- `reimbursement_amount` (float): Final reimbursement amount, rounded to 2 decimal places

#### Known Business Context
- System handles both domestic and international travel (no distinction in inputs)
- Processes approximately 15,000 reimbursement requests annually
- Average reimbursement: $487.32
- Reimbursement range: $33.78 - $2,531.43
- System has remained remarkably consistent over 60 years

### 4. Historical Data Analysis Requirements

#### Data Volume
- **Historical Cases:** 1,000 verified input/output examples
- **Time Period:** Randomly sampled from past 5 years
- **Data Quality:** All cases manually verified by accounting department
- **Accuracy Standard:** Must match legacy system within ±$0.01

#### Pattern Analysis Needed
1. **Linear Relationships:** Identify correlations between inputs and outputs
2. **Threshold Effects:** Detect if different rates apply above/below certain values
3. **Multiplicative Factors:** Determine if inputs are combined multiplicatively
4. **Business Rules:** Uncover complex conditional logic
5. **Edge Cases:** Understand behavior at extreme values

### 5. Business Logic Hypotheses

Based on institutional knowledge and industry standards from the 1960s:

#### Likely Components
1. **Daily Allowance:** Fixed amount per day of travel
2. **Mileage Reimbursement:** Rate per mile traveled
3. **Expense Reimbursement:** Percentage of receipted expenses
4. **Business Rules:** Minimum guarantees, maximum caps, or threshold-based rates

#### Historical Context (1960s Implementation)
- IRS mileage rates were much lower ($0.10-0.15 per mile)
- Daily allowances varied by government per diem rates
- Receipt reimbursement often included markup for processing
- Systems often included "fairness adjustments" or minimum guarantees

### 6. Success Criteria

#### Accuracy Requirements
- **Exact Matches:** ≥95% of test cases within ±$0.01
- **Close Matches:** ≥99% of test cases within ±$1.00
- **Average Error:** ≤$0.50 across all test cases
- **Maximum Error:** ≤$5.00 for any single case

#### Business Understanding
- **Algorithm Documentation:** Complete mathematical formula
- **Business Rule Explanation:** Clear rationale for each component
- **Edge Case Handling:** Documented behavior for unusual inputs
- **Historical Context:** Explanation of why these rates/rules were chosen

### 7. Constraints and Assumptions

#### Technical Constraints
- Algorithm must execute in <5 seconds per case
- No external dependencies (databases, APIs, etc.)
- Must work with integer and float inputs as specified
- Output must be rounded to exactly 2 decimal places

#### Business Assumptions
- Legacy system logic has remained constant over time
- All historical data represents correct calculations
- No data corruption or manual overrides in sample data
- System handles edge cases consistently

### 8. Risk Assessment

#### High Risk Items
- **Incomplete Pattern Recognition:** May miss subtle business rules
- **Historical Context Loss:** Original rationale may be unrecoverable  
- **Data Limitations:** 1,000 cases may not capture all edge cases
- **Multiple Valid Solutions:** Several algorithms might fit the data

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive statistical analysis of all relationships
- Interview long-term employees for institutional knowledge
- Test multiple algorithmic approaches
- Validate against additional historical data when available

### 9. Success Metrics

#### Primary Metrics
- **Pattern Recognition Accuracy:** R² > 0.95 for primary relationships
- **Algorithm Performance:** Matches legacy system ≥95% exactly
- **Business Logic Completeness:** All major components identified and explained

#### Secondary Metrics  
- **Documentation Quality:** Clear, maintainable algorithm documentation
- **Audit Readiness:** Can explain any reimbursement calculation to auditors
- **Knowledge Transfer:** New system team understands legacy logic

### 10. Deliverables

1. **Reverse-Engineered Algorithm:** Complete mathematical implementation
2. **Business Logic Documentation:** Explanation of each component and rate
3. **Analysis Report:** Statistical analysis of patterns and relationships
4. **Validation Results:** Performance against all test cases
5. **Implementation Guide:** Instructions for integrating into new system
